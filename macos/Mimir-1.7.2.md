# Mimir for macOS – 1.7.2

This update includes a quick hotfix for a couple player issues:
- Fixed issues where the Now Playing play/pause button in Control Center would not match the player
- Downloaded, local files should now use more accurate duration values as compared to the estimated durations used when we don't know the full size of the uncompressed audio.
