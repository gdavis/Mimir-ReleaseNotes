# iCloud and Audio Fixes
*Release 1.7.1 – February 2023*

This minor update fixes some of the more common (and annoying!) bugs in the player and with iCloud sync. Thanks for sending your feedback!

- Fixed a sync issue when importing playlist items on a device that is missing the episode because the feed is out of date
- Fixed an issue where private feeds could not load when the computer was locked
- Fixed a rare crash that could occur when updating podcast feeds
- Fixed an issue where an episode synced to another device would not automatically download
- Fixed an issue where an episode with a previous playback position could start back at the beginning when played again
- Fixed an issue where pausing the player could incorrectly adjust the timeline position
- Fixed an issue where an interrupted download could load audio from the beginning of the file when resuming playback
