Mimir for macOS â€“ 1.6.0 (132)
-----------------------------
Hello testers!

I appreciate you all for bearing with me on the pace of updates and sending your feedback. I've had to take on some contract work so updates are slower than I'd like, but things are still moving along!

Please test out the new download features in this version and let me know how it works for you.

Happy Thanksgiving to my US testers and thank you for being part of the beta!

New Features:

Automatic Downloads
- Added an option to podcast settings that, when enabled, will automatically download episode files when added to the feed
- This setting will sync between devices when using iCloud

Added a new Downloads view to the sidebar. From here you can see all files that have been downloaded and manage your downloads.
- View a summary of the number of files and total space used
- View downloads organized by podcast
- Search to quickly find downloaded episodes
- Sort by most file size, number of files, or podcast title
- Quickly remove individual files, all files for a podcast, or all downloads in the library.
- Full Drag & Drop support
- Added ability to drag downloaded episodes outside of Mimir and into other applications

Local notifications improvements
- Podcasts that are marked to show local notification will now display alerts for newly added episodes.
- Added quick-actions to the notifications to play the episode now, next, later, or view the source podcast.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue that kept downloaded files on disk longer than they should because they were not being properly marked as played.
- Updated the Setapp SDK. This should fix issues some users were having activating the app from their Setapp account.

More to come!
- More bug fixes and small improvements are planned to be added to this version before it is release, but please focus on testing the new Downloads features for now. Thanks!
