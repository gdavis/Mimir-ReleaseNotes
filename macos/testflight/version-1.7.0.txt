Mimir for macOS – 1.7.0
-----------------------

New Features:
• Added Continuous Playback Modes
- Append Mode: An initial playlist is generated and suggested episodes are appeneded to the end of the Continuous Playback playlist. Pressing the refresh button will return the playlist to its original order.
- Shuffle Mode: Episodes that would normally display in Continuous Playback are shuffled for a randomized playlist and new episodes are appended to the list. Pressing the refresh button will generate a new randomized list.
- Legacy Mode: The classic sorting style. Episodes are sorted in a standard fashion, and when sorting by highest priority, episodes will always retain their position in the playlist based on their priority.

- You can now automatically have an episode return to the top of the Up Next playlist when it is interrupted and has not yet finished playing.
