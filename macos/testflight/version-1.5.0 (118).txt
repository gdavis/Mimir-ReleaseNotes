Mimir for macOS – 1.5.0 (118)
-----------------------------
This update for Mac focuses on performance improvements and bug fixes. The app is nearly a release-ready state, and I'd love to hear your overall thoughts on both the macOS and iOS apps.

Do you like it? Love it? Hate it? Wish it had X feature? Think it is ready for release? Please tell me by leaving Beta feedback or emailing me at grant@mimirpodcasts.app

Thank you as always for helping out in the beta test!
