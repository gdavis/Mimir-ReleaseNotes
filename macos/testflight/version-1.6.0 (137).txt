Mimir for macOS â€“ 1.6.0 (137)
-----------------------------
This update improves error handling in the player, adds better error messages, and fixes some library issues.

- Fixed an issue where the player would not show a load error when the network is offline
- Fixes an issue where some podcasts would appear as though they did not import from an OPML file or Apple Podcasts if the title of the podcast did not match the RSS feed title.
- Fixed an issue where a second podcast entry could be created in the library when the RSS feed changed the podcast title
