Mimir for macOS â€“ 1.5.2 (131)
---------------------------------------------------
This small update is for fixing some uncommon but annoying issues with the audio player.

- Fixed issue where the audio player could become unresponsive after changing audio output devices
- Possible fix for an issue where an episode could become "stuck" in a loading state at the end of the file. Needs testing to confirm (#106)
