Mimir for macOS â€“ 1.5.0 (119)
-----------------------------
This update includes fixes for iCloud sync, updating episode played states, and better performance.

Please focus on iCloud sync and episode played states updating correctly for this update.

Thanks for being part of the beta!


Changes:
- Adds new button to the up next list to clear queued items
- Adds new menu item and keycommand to clear up next queue
- Fixed an issue where the Continuous Playback logic for hours could incorrectly use a podcast's episode limit instead of correctly calculating by duration. (#149)
- Fixed issue with episodes not being marked played when listening to over 50% of the episode. An episode's played state is now updated when it is no longer in the episode playlist. (#137, #123)
- Fixed import performance issues when importing a very large set of data. Updated with a much more efficient import process.
- Fixed an issue where only a partial set of data could be exported to the cloud when performing large updates. e.g. when marking a podcast as played, some of the changes would not be saved to the cloud if the dataset was over 400 records.
- Fixed issues seeking to the correct position on other devices when updating from the cloud
- Fixed an issue with the player skipping backward as much as 15 seconds when transitioning the player from loading from a web server to a locally downloaded file. Transitions should be much more accurate to where you left off. (#144)
- Fixed various minor memory leaks
