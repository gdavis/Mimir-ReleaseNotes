Mimir for macOS â€“ 1.5.0 (121)
-----------------------------
This is a small update for macOS that fixes a pretty serious UI issue that could occur. Also includes a fix to showing the correct episodes in the Top Episodes section.

Known Issues:
- The audio player can sometimes get hung at the end of an episode and not advance. Workaround: press the next button from now playing or start playing another episode

Changes:
- Fixed issue where selecting many episodes and right clicking for a context menu could lockup the UI (#155)
- Fixed issue with new episodes not appearing in Top Episodes (#146)
