New in Build 157
----------------
- Updated the podcast detail episode rows so the "expand dots" are always visible and now on the trailing side of the view
- Updated the button icon for the "more" menu in the main player controls
- Fixed the incorrect text color being used when in light mode on IAP view
- Fixed an issue where downloads made from menus might not trigger the UI to show download progress in other locations
- Fixed a text color issue for the library sidebar that would make the text hard to read for a selected row when focus is on another view
