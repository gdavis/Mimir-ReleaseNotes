What's new in 1.5

The new macOS version of Mimir contains new features that have been in the works for almost a year including an all new custom audio engine, iCloud sync, and a new mini player!

I'm very proud of all the work that has gone into this update, and hope you welcome all the new changes. I now need your help testing all these changes to make this the best release for Mimir yet!
