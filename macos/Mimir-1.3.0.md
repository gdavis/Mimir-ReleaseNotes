# Mimir for macOS – 1.3.0

Happy Spring! With the turn of the season I've been working hard on cleaning up parts of the app that were not performing well, causing crashes, and adding some needed polish to many parts of the app. This is the biggest update for Mimir yet and brings some amazing performance improvements!

The main things you'll notice are drastically increased podcast import and update times, faster "mark as played" tasks, more intuitive context menus, and new Continuous Playback options. The library has received a complete overhaul to the code running it, which fixes many UI bugs and crashes.

With spring cleaning taken care of, I'll now be setting my sights on adding new features to the app such as a downloads view, playlists, and improved podcast discovery. Please email me ([support@mimirpodcasts.app](mailto:support@mimirpodcasts.app)) to let me know what you'd like to see next. I hope you enjoy the update!

- Added a new 'Release Notes…" option to view the latest version changes
- Added a new "Welcome" option to the Help menu to open the onboarding window

### Importing/Updating Podcasts
