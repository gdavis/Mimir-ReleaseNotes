# New Audio Engine + iOS App Release
*Release 1.5.0 ‚Äì¬†Spring 2022*

Version 1.5.0 comes with the biggest set of new features for Mimir to date! Launching alongside the new iOS app, the macOS app has been updated with new features that have been in the works for many months. This includes a brand new audio processing engine that greatly improves silence skip, better audio quality at faster or slower playback speeds, voice boost enhancements, and a new sleep timer. iCloud sync has also made a return to the app to keep your desktop in sync with all your iOS devices logged into the same account.

Also included is the often requested mini player that can be opened from the macOS menu bar and is configurable to always stay on top of other windows for quick access to the playback controls. I've also been able to fit in improvements such as being able to favorite or archive episodes, UI additions for more easily downloading episodes, and a slew of other improves and bug fixes. 

Thank you for your suggestions and help improving the app!
