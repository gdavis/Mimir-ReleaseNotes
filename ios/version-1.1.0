Happy New Year! Mimir is starting off 2023 with a big update that adds a new Downloads view and a reworked custom audio player that fixes many playback issues for a solid playback experience. Thank you for your support while I continue to update the app to make it a great podcast player. Expect to see many new updates coming this year!

New Features:

Audio Player 2.0
- Internally reworked to be much more stable and accurate
- Added an AirPlay menu to the main player controls
- Improved controls for Bluetooth headsets (e.g. Airpods) with skipping forward/backward in an episode
- Many bugs fixes and stability improvements

Automatic Downloads
- Enabled in Podcast Settings, Mimir will now download new episodes added to the feed for your selected podcasts
- This setting syncs with other devices
- Added a new Downloads view to the tab bar
- View a summary of the number of files and total space used
- View downloads organized by podcast
- Search to quickly find downloaded episodes
- Sort by most file size, number of files, or podcast title
- Quickly remove individual files, all files for a podcast, or all downloads in the library

Bug Fixes:
- Updated the Setapp SDK. This should fix issues some users were having activating the app from their Setapp account.
- Fixed an issue where a separate download could start when the audio player also downloads the same file. This fixes issues with studdering audio when loading a new episode on a poor network connection.
- Fixed an issue that kept downloaded files on disk longer than they should because they were not being properly marked as played.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when reading data that caused a race condition
- Fixed a memory leak that could occur when parsing audio data packets
- Fixed issues where the episode could complete too early when skipping forward
- Fixed a crash that could occur when updating the recommendations view
- Fixed an issue where a separate download could start when the audio player also downloads the same file. This fixes issues with studdering audio when loading a new episode on a poor network connection.
- Fixed an issue where audio from the beginning of the file could be played when the player is rebuilt from an audio session interruption
- Fixes an issue where some podcasts would appear as though they did not import from an OPML file or Apple Podcasts if the title of the podcast did not match the RSS feed title.
- Fixed an issue where the keyboard page would reset when entering numbers on the podcast detail page when searching episodes
- Fixed an issue where all play icons for episode lists would show an error state if the current playing episode failed playback
- Fixed an issue where the wrong podcast image would continue showing when switching playing episodes and the incoming image was slow or failed to load
- Fixed a button alignment issue in the Up next playlist rows
- Fixed an issue where a second podcast entry could be created in the library when the RSS feed changed the podcast title
