# New Sharing Features
*Release 1.4.0 – April 2023*

This relatively small release includes some new sharing features, UI improvements, and bug fixes. You can now share links to episodes or podcasts through various sharing services. In a future update I plan on adding support for sharing to specific timestamps, or sharing a short audio clip.

- Added share actions to context menus when long pressing episodes or podcasts in the library or episode tabs
- Added a "more" button to the podcast detail with several actions: Share podcast, Refresh Feed, and Settings
- Added a "more" button to the Now Playing view's navigation bar with several actions: Share, Return Episode to Queue, Clear Now Playing
- Added some user reviews to the purchases window. Thanks for all the stars!
- Fixed an issue where the last publish date for a podcast could show "53 years ago"
- Fixed issue with Now Playing view not updating when clearing the current episode
- Fixed a memory leak that could lead to a crash from download operations
