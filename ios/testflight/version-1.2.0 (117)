Mimir for iOS – 1.2.0
---------------------
New Features:
• Added Continuous Playback Modes
- Append Mode: An initial playlist is generated and suggested episodes are appeneded to the end of the Continuous Playback playlist. Pressing the refresh button will return the playlist to its original order.
- Shuffle Mode: Episodes that would normally display in Continuous Playback are shuffled for a randomized playlist and new episodes are appended to the list. Pressing the refresh button will generate a new randomized list.
- Legacy Mode: The classic sorting style. Episodes are sorted in a standard fashion, and when sorting by highest priority, episodes will always retain their position in the playlist based on their priority.

• Return to Queue
- You can now automatically have an episode return to the top of the Up Next playlist when it is interrupted and has not yet finished playing.
- Added a button to enable this feature in the Settings > Playback preferences
- Added a button to the current playing episode cell to stop playback and return the episode to the top of Up Next

• Background Updates
- The app now fully supports background tasks to perform feed updates while not using the app.

Changes:
- Added new refresh button to Continuous Playback list
- Added append mode selection to Continuous Playback settings
- Improved logic around updating subscribed podcast feeds
- Fixed a crash that could occur when the audio player is interrupted by another audio source
