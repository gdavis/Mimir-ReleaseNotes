Mimir for iOS â€“ 1.0.0 (95)
--------------------------
Today's update adds a (hopefully) final set of color schemes and custom silence skip sounds I'd love for you to try out.

The color schemes are named after the 9 realms of Norse mythology and tries to use colors that might represent each realm. Let me know if you agree!

New custom silence skip sounds allow you to change from the default "snip" sound that has been in the app. Let me know what you think of these, and if you have suggestions for others!

For the next update I'm trying to work out the final audio issues and the last changes before sending to the App Store. Thanks as always for helping test!

Known Issues:
- The audio player can sometimes get hung at the end of an episode and not advance. Workaround: press the next button from now playing or start playing another episode

Changes:
- Added new color schemes and updated existing ones with new color palettes.
- Added a new row under Settings > Playback > Skip Sound. Here you can view a list where you can sample and select a new skip sound (#156)
- Fixed issue where the player would not advance to the next track when pressing the play button with no current playing episode. There does need to be an episode in the Up Next queue, or have Continuous Playback enabled for this to work.
- Fixed issue importing files from iCloud Drive and other similar external file locations (#159)
- Fixed issue where the audio player timeline would continue to advance while on a phone call (#168)
- Fixed an issue sizing the Discover section genre list cells (#171)
- Fixed an issue where audio would pause when disconnecting headphones when outputting audio to another bluetooth device (#170)
