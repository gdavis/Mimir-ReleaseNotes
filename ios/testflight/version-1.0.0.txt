Mimir 1.0
---------
Thank you for your interest in helping test the new iOS version of Mimir! This app adds a ton of new features that I hope will make a great podcast listening experience. 

The iOS app has been in development for almost a full year but is finally ready to get into your hands and play some podcasts. Mimir fully supports both iPhone and iPad, including split view on the iPad. 

The macOS app is also receiving a big update along with the release of this iOS version, and can also be tested with the TestFlight app when using macOS Monterey. If you can, please test both versions and enable iCloud to help test the syncing features.


Full Release Notes

Known Issues
------------
These bugs are already in queue for fixing and will be addressed before release. If you encounter any of these, please know a fix is coming soon! If you can consistently reproduce these issues, please use the Bug Report feature in the Support menu to let me know how you made it happen.

- Skipping forward in a episode that has not yet been downloaded can rarely fail and skip to the next track.
- Some episodes can fail to complete playback when reaching the end of the file and not automatically advance to the next track. Workaround the issue by manually tapping the next track button.
- Some episodes with very long titles, or when using large dynamic type, can cause the UI to be cramped and cut off certain UI elements.
- When using Bluetooth player, such as car audio, sometimes an episode can show an incorrect duration. Seeking in this state can fail and cause the player to play the next episode.
- When syncing with other devices, sometimes data from the local device will overwrite the iCloud data.


Tips and Tricks
---------------
- Tap and hold on the navigation bar on any screen to quickly change from light or dark mode.
- Tap and hold on groups, podcasts, and episodes to get a context menu for common actions.
- Swipe left or right on podcast or episode cells for quick actions.
- Tap and hold to rearrange the up next episode playlist.
- Use the podcast priority setting to have episodes from your favorite podcasts appear more often in the Continuous Playback list.


Testing Mimir
-------------
While testing, please use the Bug Report form for any issues you may encounter. This is found under 'Settings > Support > Report Bug'. Please be as descriptive as you can when adding a bug report to help me find and fix issues!

You can also send an email using 'Settings > Support > Send Feedback' option to send feature requests, give feedback, or attach screenshots or video that may help with bug reports. You can also email me directly at support@mimirpodcasts.app  

Mimir currently supports importing podcast library in OPML format, which most popular podcasting apps support. Import by saving an OPML file to the Files app and choosing the "Open in Mimir" option. 

The beta is planned to hopefully only take a month or so before Mimir is ready to launch, but could take longer if any major issues are found. Please take the time to help get the app ready by submitting feedback and bug reports. Mimir is a one-developer project, so all the help I can get in testing goes a long way!


Coming Later in Beta
--------------------
The following features are coming later in the beta test and will arrive before the iOS app launches.

- Import from Apple Podcasts
- More Color Schemes
- Custom Silence Skip Sounds
- In-App Purchases
- Release Notes
