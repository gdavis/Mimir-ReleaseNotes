Mimir for iOS â€“ 1.0.0 (86)
--------------------------
This update completely reworks the iCloud sync system in the app. There were some serious issues with the previous approach such as:

- The podcasts library could sometimes be blank (https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/issues/98)
- The played episode history revert to an incorrect state (https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/issues/92)

The new iCloud sync system uses a totally new approach and solves these serious issues that were plaguing the previous builds. This is also more performant and sync updates with other devices will be much faster.

Please give this new version a test on all your devices and let me know how it works for you.

Thank you for your patience with this update since this was a big one for me!
