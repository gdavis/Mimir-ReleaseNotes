Mimir for iOS – 1.1.0 (105)
--------------------------
This update brings a new major version of the custom audio player to the app that fixes many of the the existing issues with the player, including the notorious bug where episodes hang at the end of the episode!

To bring this update, the player has been drastically overhauled for better performance, state management, seeking, and error handling. Please thoroughly test the audio player and let me know how it works for you.

Since this is a big rework, there may be new issues I have not yet discovered, by overall I believe you will have a much better player experience.

Thank you for helping test and I hope you all had a great holiday!
