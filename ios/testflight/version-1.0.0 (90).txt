Mimir for iOS â€“ 1.0.0 (90)
--------------------------
In-App Purchases are now available! As a TestFlight beta tester, you will NOT be charged real money when making purchases within the app. Please try out the purchase system and let me know what you think of the pricing and feature offerings!

Mimir now has three tiers of access: free, pro and premium. The free plan gives you access to all the standard library features such as groups, password-protected RSS feeds, and standard playback options. Ads will display in the Discover section to help pay for the 3rd party services that provide curated lists, recommendations, and search features.

Mimir Pro is a one-time purchase that will unlock the audio enhancements, app customization features, and continuous playback for the iOS app. Mimir Premium is the subscription tier that will unlock all app features and remove banner ads from the Discover section of the app and is available in a monthly or yearly plan. Premium also unlocks all features for both iOS and macOS apps, while Pro will just unlock features for the platform it is purchased on.

This update also fixes the main nagging crashing issues from the last update, and fixes a lot of other minor UI issues.

I hope you like it, and please let me know how your experience with Mimir is going!
