Mimir for iOS – 1.0.0 (88)
--------------------------
Changes for iOS:
- Updated the Playlist icon on the mini player to be larger
- Updated the page dots on the mini player to not collide with content with long titles
- Updated the Up Next editing behavior. The Edit button has been removed, which was causing a clunky experience to change what episodes were in queue and how episodes were ordered. Moved the More ("…") button to be more prominent for episodes actions.
- Fixed an issue where the swipe action to go between the 'Now Playing' and 'Playlist' pages could stop working
- Fixed an issue where the Now Playing modal view would dismiss too early when swiping down on the page. Corrected so it only dismisses if the content scroll view is scrolled all the way to the top

Changes for both iOS and macOS:
- Updated the Continuous Playback "Highest Priority" sorting logic to respect the sort option for each podcast. This means high priority podcasts that are set to play from "oldest to newest" will correctly show older episodes first when showing episodes in the playlist.
- Updated logic for automatically marking an episode as "played" when it has reached the end of the file. If less than 5% of the file remains to be played, or less than 30 seconds, the episode will be marked as played.
- Fixed some issues with the initial "played" value for Episodes in the library. Users who have already synced their library with iCloud may see some episodes appear in the incorrect played state, but will resolve after setting episodes back to their proper played state. Sorry about that, but the logic will be much more consistent for tracking played episodes with this update.
- Fixed issue with newly added podcast episodes not appearing in the Continuous Playback list
- Fixed high CPU usage that could occur updating the Continuous Playback list while listening to an episode.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when deleting objects with iCloud enabled
