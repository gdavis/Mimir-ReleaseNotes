Mimir for iOS â€“ 1.0.1 (100)
---------------------------
The iOS launch version and macOS update are both now available on the App Store!

Thank you everyone who helped out during the beta test. The launch went very smoothly and I have many of you to thank for reporting issues and requesting features.

This update adds support for Setapp. If you have an existing desktop Setapp account, you can now unlock Mimir and all the premium features!
