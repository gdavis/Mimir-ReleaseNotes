Mimir for iOS – 1.0.0 (94)
--------------------------
Hi testers! This update has a lot of fixes for interface issues and some fixes for importing libraries. There are a few audio issues that still need to be ironed out, and a final set of color schemes added, but the app is near official release!

Please let me know how your app experience has been and if you have any issues.
