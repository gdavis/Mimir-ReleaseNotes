Mimir for iOS â€“ 1.0.0 (91)
--------------------------
This update focuses on fixing sync issues and adding some polish to the app. The app is nearly a release-ready state, and I'd love to hear your overall thoughts on the iOS app.

Do you like it? Love it? Hate it? Wish it had X feature? Think it is ready for release? Please tell me by leaving Beta feedback or emailing me at grant@mimirpodcasts.app

Thank you as always for helping out in the beta test!
